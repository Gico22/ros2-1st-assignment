# ros2-1st-assignment
This ROS2 package implements the first assignment for the Research Track course. It controls two turtles in the turtlesim simulator using a UI node that publishes velocity commands for exactly one second through a timer, and a Distance node that monitors the turtles' poses, computes their distance, and stops them if needed.
